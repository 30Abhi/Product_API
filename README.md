## Overview
A lightweight, OpenAI‚Äëpowered Product API that takes product titles or basic details and returns rich marketing copy‚Äîincluding descriptions, FAQs, bullet points, pros & cons, and meta tags‚Äîin JSON format.

Built with Node.js and Express, this API abstracts away manual copywriting by integrating directly with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models to deliver high‚Äëquality content on demand.

##üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Node.js: A cross‚Äëplatform, open‚Äësource JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 engine, enabling server‚Äëside scripting with JavaScript 


Express.js: Minimal and flexible Node.js web framework providing robust routing and middleware support for rapid API development 


OpenAI API: GPT‚Äëpowered completions and chat endpoints for generative text, including product descriptions and FAQs 

Mongo Databse: Uses Mongo URI to interact and fetch product names .(see env configurations below)


dotenv: Zero‚Äëdependency module to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env, following Twelve‚ÄëFactor App methodology

## ‚ú® Features
Generate Product Descriptions: Submit a title or basic specs and receive an engaging, SEO‚Äëfriendly description.

Auto‚ÄëFAQ Generation: Produce commonly asked Q&A pairs based on product context.

Bullet‚ÄëPoint Highlights: Create concise feature lists and pros/cons summaries.

Meta Tags & SEO: Auto‚Äëgenerate meta titles, descriptions, and keywords.

RESTful Endpoints: Standard HTTP methods, JSON payloads, and clear status codes.

## Performance & Cost Analysis ‚è±Ô∏èüí∏

### Throughput Time
| Endpoint | Avg. Response Time | Factors Affecting Speed |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| All endpoints | 2-5 seconds | - OpenAI API latency<br>- Input complexity<br>- Server resources<br>- Network speed |

Typical workflow for 100 product descriptions:
1. API calls: ~100 requests
2. Total time: 4-8 minutes (at 3-5 seconds/request)
3. Parallel processing recommended for bulk operations

### Cost Estimation (OpenAI)
Based on GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct pricing ($0.002/1K tokens):
| Component | Tokens/Request | Cost/Request | Cost per 1K Requests |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Prompt | ~50 tokens | $0.0001 | $0.10 |
| Response | ~100 tokens | $0.0002 | $0.20 |
| **Total** | **150 tokens** | **$0.0003** | **$0.30** |

**Example Scenario**:
- Generating 500 product descriptions:
  - Total tokens: 500 √ó 150 = 75,000
  - Estimated cost: 75 √ó $0.002 = $0.15
